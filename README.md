It lets you create a text file that lists all the beatmaps you have (ranked, unranked, loved etc.), share it with friends, and let them download the beatmaps you dont already have.

Download the program from this [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EE45jg3JzN7UaU32dQxBKwD3OzqsdgGI)


## How to use:
Go inside the directory OsuBeatmapStealer and run the file inside of the main directory
### Option 1:
Creates a file called beatmaps.txt that lists all the beatmaps you have. Share this with others so they can download your beatmaps
### Option 2:
Before choosing this option **make sure you get a beatmaps.txt file from someone else**

I put a sample beatmaps file inside, it has some maps in it and you can try the program with it

## Errors:
If you get any errors, it will create a file called error_log.txt send it over to me in discord (Collector#5029) or to my email available on my github profile
