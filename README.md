# OsuBeatmapStealer

### What does it do:
It lets you create a text file that lists all the beatmaps you have (ranked, unranked, loved etc.), share it with friends, and let them download the beatmaps he has you dont already have.


## How to setup:
Download the program from this [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EE45jg3JzN7UaU32dQxBKwD3OzqsdgGI)

Unzip it and move the unzipped directory next to where your osu is currently installed like this:

(make sure inside the unzipped folder there is a single shortcut and a single folder)


## How to use:
Go inside the directory OsuBeatmapStealer and run the main.exe file inside of the main directory
### Option 1:
Creates a file called beatmaps.txt that lists all the beatmaps you have. Share this with others so they can download your beatmaps
### Option 2:
Before choosing this option **make sure you get a beatmaps.txt file from someone else and put it inside of the directory like so**, otherwise the program just wont do anything:

**Make sure you are logged into the osu website other wise you won't be able to download any beatmaps**

Choose option 2 and let your browser start downloading the missing beatmaps for you!

You can find the downloaded beatmaps in your computer's downloads folder

(You can close the program at any stage, open the beatmaps it downloaded so far and continue later)
