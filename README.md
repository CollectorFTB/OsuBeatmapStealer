# OsuBeatmapStealer

### What does it do:
It lets you create a text file that lists all the beatmaps you have (ranked, unranked, loved etc.), share it with friends, and let them download the beatmaps you dont already have.


## How to setup:
Download the program from this [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EE45jg3JzN7UaU32dQxBKwD3OzqsdgGI)

Unzip it and **move the unzipped directory next to where your osu is currently installed like this**:

## How to use:
Go inside the directory OsuBeatmapStealer and run the main.exe file inside of the main directory
### Option 1:
Creates a file called beatmaps.txt that lists all the beatmaps you have. Share this with others so they can download your beatmaps
### Option 2:
Before choosing this option **make sure you get a beatmaps.txt file from someone else and put it inside of the directory like so**, otherwise the program just wont do anything:

I put a sample beatmaps.txt file inside just to demonstrate where it should be, it has some maps in it and you can try the program with it

**Make sure you are logged into the osu website otherwise you won't be able to download any beatmaps**

Choose option 2 and let your browser start downloading the missing beatmaps for you!

You can find the downloaded beatmaps in your computer's downloads folder

(You can close the program at any stage, open the beatmaps it downloaded so far and continue later, better just let it run over night or let it work a couple of minutues at a time because it will open a new browser tab every couple of seconds)
